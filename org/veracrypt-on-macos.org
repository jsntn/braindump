* How to execute veracrypt command line?
The command is actually =/Applications/VeraCrypt.app/Contents/MacOS/VeraCrypt=.

While there should always be an elegant way to use it!\\
You can set up a symbolic link named =veracrypt= to the executable. The following will work in a terminal,

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mkdir -p ~/bin ; # <<-- if it doesn't exist already
  ln -s /Applications/VeraCrypt.app/Contents/MacOS/VeraCrypt ~/bin/veracrypt
#+END_SRC

You can then invoke it to get help with (the =-t= is for text-only mode):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" ; # <<-- if not already on your search path
  veracrypt -t -h
#+END_SRC

Start using it, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  veracrypt -m ro -k <keyfile> <volume> # mount the volume with keyfile in read-only mode
#+END_SRC
