> The Zettelkasten method was made famous by Niklas Luhmann, who was a German
> sociologist who published over 70 books and 400 academic articles (Ahrens,
> 2017, pp.30). Luhmann credited his achievements to his Zettelkasten, which
> contained over 90,000 ideas that helped him develop topics by knitting
> together ideas into a cohesive whole. His books wrote themselves, idea by
> idea. Even after his death, Luhmann's ideas were combined to publish more
> books on his behalf.
>
> The word Zettelkasten is German for "slip box", which refers to a box
> containing many slips of paper (Ahrens, 2017). Each slip represents a single,
> atomic idea that makes sense by itself, and also in combination with other
> ideas (similar to how our brain works, but with a better memory).
