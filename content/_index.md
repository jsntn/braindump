# Hey there! {#hi}

This is [Jason](https://jsntn.com/), an Emacs user stays a lot on
[haikebang.org](https://haikebang.org) recently.

You've chanced upon my braindump, it contains my notes accumulated over years,
and they're in a really messy transition state.

I can't make good entry-points, only a full index can be found [here](/posts/).
